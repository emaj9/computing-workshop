    Computation Workshop Working Syllabus

    * Goals *

By the end of the workshop, students wil be able to:

COMPUTERS
=========

  * (Hardware:)

      * identify hardware components and their function;

  * (Operating system:)

      * identify core services provided by an operating system;
      * identify how the operating system manages resources;

  * (Applications:)

      * identify the boundaries and relationships between application,
        operating system, and hardware;
      * define what a program is;
      * explain the process of downloading a resource from a remote host;
      * explain the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in displaying a web page
        in a browser;
      * categorize different networking protocols (application vs. hardware);
      * break down the process from computer poweron to operating system
        startup.

  * Peronsal use

      * Interact with github, value online commmunities, value and respect open source matierial 
      * How to navigate online resources and take autonomy of their own
        learning

PROGRAMMING
===========

  * Translate a world problem into code: - identify key types, writing algorithm 
  * Use haskell as a calculator
  * Run haskell programs using dependencies
  * Differentiate between values, types, types classes, and kind
  * Type check expression
  * Implement and use higher order functions (and partial applications)
  * Can use IO monad to create interactive programs
  * Can identify types that are functors
  * Use do notation for a variety of monads (Maybe, Either a, so on...)



(To be dealt with: static site generator, Bridge software life cycle - deployment stack, cabal)

WEB DEV
=======

  * Conceptualize a website and then create it
  * Characterize the historic trends in web dev
  * Create aethestics websites using golden ratio, negative space, colour theory
  * Use appropriate elements of HTML - hamburger text markup language
  * Use Flexbox to make reponsibe websites
  * Use appropriate CSS selectors and rules
  * Building reusable web components,
  * Use Javascript to: modify the dom, make http requests
  * Navigate the Hakyll library to generate a static website

Lesson Sequencing
=================

    Computers:

1 - Taking part a computer, each components purpose
2 - What happens when you turn your computer on?
3 - Building the heirarchy: fundamental differences between OSs
4 - Defining the boundry between OS and applications
5 - What is a program?
6 - How does downloading a file work? How do browserse work? 
7 - How to manage your projects
8 - Exploring the online community

    Haskell:

1 - Basic calculations, getting familiar with Prelude, characteristics of haskell
2 - Basic types and values: Char, Int, Lists, Tuples, Maybe - Constructors
3 - Types, type classes, kind
4 - Functions: make your own functions
5 - Functions: partial application, functions as values, modules
6 - Functor, applicative, monad
7 - Monads and the do block
8 - review, problems, abstraction

    Web dev:

1 - Breif history of web development
2 - HTML, an introduction
3 - CSS, an introduction
4 - Combining the two and Java
5 - Hakyll
6 - What makes a beautiful website? 
7 - Applying differnet website styles
8 - Website work
