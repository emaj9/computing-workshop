interview 2

what is your understanding of critical pedagogy?

Good question. Both of my parents are university professors and immigrated to the US from Mexico in their late teens and
were the only ones in their family to have graduate from high school. My mom comes from a family of 5 siblings, my dad a
family of 6 siblings. not only were they the only in their family to graduate from highschool, the were the oly ones to
pursue higher education culminating in a phd. Both my parents teach linguistics and spanish language, as well as the
culture connections and perspective in the space. Their degree is in latin america literature. Therefore cp and civic
engagement, movement making, theoretical foundations of community activism, have all been a part of my upbringing. My
mom is a poet and activist, my father teaches latin american films and arts - and both recently retired. So my
conversations around the dinner table where about culture, politics, civil rights, and movement making.

With that formation and foundation, I was reading a lot of these books that my parents had in the home. In highschool in
particular I became very involved in activism and ultimately gradually from UC Boulder in ethnic studies. In my BA I
became very aware of critical theory, critical race theory, and a educational lense and critical pedagogy. those
practices and my lived experiences informed me. my masters of fine arts and graduate degree in emergent digital
practices. it came from more the digital space, and my thesis project was about using emerging technology to engage the
conversation around gentrification - before the invention of the smartphone and social media. My work was constantly
about using emerging technology to engage in critical dialogue, to expose, explore, engage, and unpack a range of
different societal issues - making the convergence between the physcial and the virtual in so many spaces and how
technology enhances, accelerates, or impacts (negatively or positively) how we as people live in this world and create
equitable space, advocate for unrepresented and marginalized communities, how we engage educational practices as a
mechanism and vehicle for liberation and how tech can accelorate and amplify so many of these things - not only in the
use of this technology as a consumer and creator of technology. It's about being able to create and build technology
that ultimately solves problems in our community and expands beyond commerical viability. For us, our ongoing mission in
our company and products called Code Society, this is the theoretical foundation and the whole formation of how we build
curricula and all of our work.  For us as entrepenuers, we're not creating the next pizza delivery app, it's not about
building some tool that eases the feasibility of whatever kind of consummer goal. It's about using technology to have a
critical impact to transform our community from the inside out and teach these concepts through a critical
perspective. The computer science and technology space is so fundamentally devoid of the liberals and critical space the
entire higher education pipelines and training mechanisms are so technology focused there is a huge lacking of a
critical perspective. We found the unique opportunity to bring the liberal arts and the critical persepctive into the
hard science and CS, and then bringing CS into the liberal arts and bridging that gap in a way.

Q: what is not part of your understanding of critical pedagogy?
---------------------------------------------------------------

That's a great question. Fundamentally, if there isn't a critical lense, meaning if an educator or students, whoever is
engaging some content, if there isn't questioning and asking fundamentally assessing what the root and context of this
piece of information you're engaging with, if there isn't a question or analysis about where this content or knowledge
comes from, then that is absolutely misses it entirely. My fundamental belief is that everything exists in
context. Contextually, humans have existed on a historical timeline whether that be linear or circular, and depends on
what has happened before and what will happen after. The belief that things happen in isolation or spontaneously arrive
like manifested out of no where, that is fundamentally not at all critical perspective.

Questining what we believe is true, what is fact. In the technical space (CS and engineering), so much of what science
is is fundamentally based on facts - what has existed before. That's why it contributes to this [dismay?]. That's one
thing, that things always exist in context and if you don't teach or engage in a piece of information in that lense then
you're not engaging in any kind of critical persepective or cp. If as an educator you're not encouraging students to
challenge and questions and derive their own answers and ulimately step out of the way so you're not the one departing
all of the knowledge and gifting all of this knowledge to your young people, if you're moving out of the way and
facilitating experience for young people to find their conclusions through expirimentation and engagement, that's a
really important part of what is critical.

Related to that is to know that we live in a racialized, gendered, so many different levels, capitalistic society, this
is our context and our environment. There is a racial and gendered foundation and sexual identity, religious, foundation
to all of our institutions and we exist in these institutions. If you're not critically building a relationship with
those institutions and how these institutions infleunce us as individuals and fields of study and entire technology
space (like different types of veritcals and business space) - if we assume those institutions are pure and biasless,
then that's doing a major disservice to our community and country.

Q: You say we live in a racialized and gendered society, that is the context we are living and teaching in, how does keeping that
-
context in mind influence the way you teach? How does that change the way you teach if you know in the back of your head
-
that we live in this racialized and gendered society?
-

Great question, I think what we do is we design experiences where young people are able to engage in content and find
and make connections in their own way. THe fundamental way we do this is in our teaching practice. For example, with
code society we use original hip hop music to teach computational thinking concepts. Imagine a school house rock for
computer science. These are pre-coding concepts - so we are not teaching syntaax like python, js, html. These are
pre-coding concepts that are forming the fundamentals. This is a testament to what the field has witnessed in its
eduaction practice: so much of it was so technical focused that they realized there needs to be a step before that and
that's where we've seen this explosion in computational thinking and conversations around that. That is proven by the
field itself.

We engage ct concepts and translate them using popular culture references, youth culutre references, all delivered
through original lyrics in musical form. We have a song and unit, for example, called "algorithm". We use a couple
different frameworks, we use the NYC blue print for CS as well as the AP CS principles, to establish key concepts. In
the blueprint there are 5 key primary ct concepts with a series of subconcepts tied to each one of those - algorithm is
one of those concepts. We've got all these individual standards, definitions of algoithms, sub concepts of algorithms
(composition, pattern recognizion, I/O, etc), these are all concepts that a bit abstract if you don't have that
technical foundations, and we write original lyrics that translate those and put those into musical forms. Students are
literally signing the definition of these concepts through this song. More importantly, we build interactive, project
based lerning experiences around that which contextualizes that into a practical form - taking concepts from theoretical
to practical form. One way we do that is through viral dance challenges. There was a really famous one taht happened a
few years ago. Drake the artists created a song called "create me feelings" and created a dance challenge. There were
many challenges like get out of a car and dance, it was this whole pop culture phenominon. Students, young people, if
you play that song anywhere, young people will dance the dance. It's amazing the power of popular culture and the
virality of pop culture and how a connected world through devices magnifies this to levels we could never imagine.

So we use a kiki dance challenge as an example of an algorithm. Break down the dance into its dance and pieces, step one
is this, so on. The definition of an algorithm is the steps and sequences needed to solve a problem. We go through that
whole process, break it down, and in the lyrics of the music, ask students what problem was Drake trying to solve? Which
students have fun with as they create their own own answers (he's trying to solve his loneliness, lack of love,
insecurities etc). This puts students prior experience and knolwedge front and center in the learning experience. Then
through design thinking practices, we ask students to take a step back and identify problems in different levels on
their world. It could be in their family, school, community, country, world, so on, it could be different problems
depending on their age. We've heard of everything from gun violence, to bully, to depression, to suicide, to food
deserts, wanting to solve the crisis in venezula. We ask students to identify a whole range of issues then ask them to
break that problem down - if they were to solve that problem, even if it is high level and abstract, break down that
problem into steps and sequences they would need to do to solve this problem. Then we ask students to define dance moves
or steps that illustrate or capture each one of the steps (in the solution). The students are ultimately making a viral
dance challenge that is solving the steps to the problem they have identified. That's using a critical lense to solve
problems using critical thinking skills. None of our dances have gone viral at this point, but we contextualize how the
viral dance challenge how a dance challenge becomes a dance challenge. So it's about composition and how technology
works: there is a dnace, artists, someone recording, then that media is shared on a social media platform assoicated
with a hashtag, and the algorithms within ig and yt compile these media pieces that compile and display these pieces of
media. That's how the algorithms within these platforms are working and functioning - there are multiple levels of
perspectives that are decomposed and abstracted in these technological concept.

> ME:
So you talk about algorithms while making the dance to introduce them to it,
then you circle back and talk to them about alrogithms at the end of their
production to talk about how their dance video is distributed on this platform -
how algorithms and hastags work together to share this kind of stuff. Am i
understanding correctly?

You got it. One of the facsinating things we've learned is that we partnered
with other coding organizations focused on coding and teaching coding to young
people, and one thing they struggle with is students can code and build what
they want in programming languages - but just because they can code, they can't
give a definition of an algorithm - they don't know what an alogrithm is. We've
been meeting with HR professionals, engineering folks who hire, for example one
of our advisors is a VP of a big engineering company in NY, and time and time
again to the people we talk to say that these coding bootcamps (general
assemble, apple academy, so on all these coding bootcamps that have developed to
meet the demands of the market) are developing coders who are sufficient in one
language (python, ruby), and they come out with the hard technical skills to
pull things off fast but have two major problems: the second they step out of
their scripting language their lost and second once you add critical problem
solving and innovation thinking, they're in deep water - they don't know how to
engage in taht process. However they can get a specfic function to work in a
specific way becuase they are technically trained to execute the task at hand,
but the problem solving and analytical skills are completely void from those
experiences. We bring that whole ciritcal lense and perspective - not just the
how - how do you do this, but also the why and the what - what is this used for?
how can you use this in your community? It's a tool at the end of the day, and
so much at the end of these teaching programs is devoid of humanity even though
so much of it is user centered, like scrum. but it's user centered to create a
great experience for a monetary game - its not to impact or change elements of
our society or critically analyze or have new perspective. It's not about that.

Q: Can you tell me more about the - and this can be brief - the specifics at the
organization you work with? Where are you working, who are you teaching, what
ages?

I co-founded code society 2 years ago. My co founder is Jenith. We were former
colleagues at a non-profit org that has since fallen apart. We identified this
unique opportunity: 1 we established a strong and authentic relationship. We
created a creative education agency where we're using emmerging technology to
build an interactive learning experiences, using VR and AR for museums. Code
society started as a project within that creative agency. When we started
testing and engaging different spaces, we saw there was a high interest and need
for this lense of teaching in the tech space. We spun it out and formed an
independent entity around: code society was incorporated in May. We've been
building it from scratch.
