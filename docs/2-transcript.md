INTERVIEW 2

# what is your understanding of critical pedagogy?

Good question. Both of my parents are university professors and immigrated to the US from Mexico in their late teens and
were the only ones in their family to have graduate from high school. My mom comes from a family of 5 siblings, my dad a
family of 6 siblings. not only were they the only in their family to graduate from highschool, the were the oly ones to
pursue higher education culminating in a phd. Both my parents teach linguistics and spanish language, as well as the
culture connections and perspective in the space. Their degree is in latin america literature. Therefore cp and civic
engagement, movement making, theoretical foundations of community activism, have all been a part of my upbringing. My
mom is a poet and activist, my father teaches latin american films and arts - and both recently retired. So my
conversations around the dinner table where about culture, politics, civil rights, and movement making.

With that formation and foundation, I was reading a lot of these books that my parents had in the home. In highschool in
particular I became very involved in activism and ultimately gradually from UC Boulder in ethnic studies. In my BA I
became very aware of critical theory, critical race theory, and a educational lense and critical pedagogy. those
practices and my lived experiences informed me. my masters of fine arts and graduate degree in emergent digital
practices. it came from more the digital space, and my thesis project was about using emerging technology to engage the
conversation around gentrification - before the invention of the smartphone and social media. My work was constantly
about using emerging technology to engage in critical dialogue, to expose, explore, engage, and unpack a range of
different societal issues - making the convergence between the physcial and the virtual in so many spaces and how
technology enhances, accelerates, or impacts (negatively or positively) how we as people live in this world and create
equitable space, advocate for unrepresented and marginalized communities, how we engage educational practices as a
mechanism and vehicle for liberation and how tech can accelerate and amplify so many of these things - not only in the
use of this technology as a consumer and creator of technology. It's about being able to create and build technology
that ultimately solves problems in our community and expands beyond commercial viability. For us, our ongoing mission in
our company and products called Code Society, this is the theoretical foundation and the whole formation of how we build
curricula and all of our work.  For us as entrepreneurs, we're not creating the next pizza delivery app, it's not about
building some tool that eases the feasibility of whatever kind of consummer goal. It's about using technology to have a
critical impact to transform our community from the inside out and teach these concepts through a critical
perspective. The computer science and technology space is so fundamentally devoid of the liberals and critical space the
entire higher education pipelines and training mechanisms are so technology focused there is a huge lacking of a
critical perspective. We found the unique opportunity to bring the liberal arts and the critical persepctive into the
hard science and CS, and then bringing CS into the liberal arts and bridging that gap in a way.

Q: what is not part of your understanding of critical pedagogy?
---------------------------------------------------------------

That's a great question. Fundamentally, if there isn't a critical lense, meaning if an educator or students, whoever is
engaging some content, if there isn't questioning and asking fundamentally assessing what the root and context of this
piece of information you're engaging with, if there isn't a question or analysis about where this content or knowledge
comes from, then that is absolutely misses it entirely. My fundamental belief is that everything exists in
context. Contextually, humans have existed on a historical timeline whether that be linear or circular, and depends on
what has happened before and what will happen after. The belief that things happen in isolation or spontaneously arrive
like manifested out of no where, that is fundamentally not at all critical perspective.

Questioning what we believe is true, what is fact. In the technical space (CS and engineering), so much of what science
is fundamentally based on facts - what has existed before. That's why it contributes to this [dismay?]. That's one
thing, that things always exist in context and if you don't teach or engage in a piece of information in that lense then
you're not engaging in any kind of critical persepective or cp. If as an educator you're not encouraging students to
challenge and questions and derive their own answers and ulimately step out of the way so you're not the one departing
all of the knowledge and gifting all of this knowledge to your young people, if you're moving out of the way and
facilitating experience for young people to find their conclusions through expirimentation and engagement, that's a
really important part of what is critical.

Related to that is to know that we live in a racialized, gendered, so many different levels, capitalistic society, this
is our context and our environment. There is a racial and gendered foundation and sexual identity, religious, foundation
to all of our institutions and we exist in these institutions. If you're not critically building a relationship with
those institutions and how these institutions infleunce us as individuals and fields of study and entire technology
space (like different types of verticals and business space) - if we assume those institutions are pure and biasless,
then that's doing a major disservice to our community and country.

# Q: You say we live in a racialized and gendered society, that is the context we are living and teaching in, how does keeping that
# context in mind influence the way you teach? How does that change the way you teach if you know in the back of your head
# that we live in this racialized and gendered society?

Great question, I think what we do is we design experiences where young people are able to engage in content and find
and make connections in their own way. The fundamental way we do this is in our teaching practice. For example, with
code society we use original hip hop music to teach computational thinking concepts. Imagine a school house rock for
computer science. These are pre-coding concepts - so we are not teaching syntax like python, js, html. These are
pre-coding concepts that are forming the fundamentals. This is a testament to what the field has witnessed in its
eduaction practice: so much of it was so technical focused that they realized there needs to be a step before that and
that's where we've seen this explosion in computational thinking and conversations around that. That is proven by the
field itself.

We engage ct concepts and translate them using popular culture references, youth culutre references, all delivered
through original lyrics in musical form. We have a song and unit, for example, called "algorithm". We use a couple
different frameworks, we use the NYC blue print for CS as well as the AP CS principles, to establish key concepts. In
the blueprint there are 5 key primary ct concepts with a series of sub-concepts tied to each one of those - algorithm is
one of those concepts. We've got all these individual standards, definitions of algorithms, sub concepts of algorithms
(composition, pattern recognizion, I/O, etc), these are all concepts that a bit abstract if you don't have that
technical foundations, and we write original lyrics that translate those and put those into musical forms. Students are
literally signing the definition of these concepts through this song. More importantly, we build interactive, project
based lerning experiences around that which contextualizes that into a practical form - taking concepts from theoretical
to practical form. One way we do that is through viral dance challenges. There was a really famous one that happened a
few years ago. Drake the artists created a song called "in my feelings" and created a dance challenge. There were
many challenges like get out of a car and dance, it was this whole pop culture phenomenon. Students, young people, if
you play that song anywhere, young people will dance the dance. It's amazing the power of popular culture and the
virality of pop culture and how a connected world through devices magnifies this to levels we could never imagine.

So we use a kiki dance challenge as an example of an algorithm. Break down the dance into its dance and pieces, step one
is this, so on. The definition of an algorithm is the steps and sequences needed to solve a problem. We go through that
whole process, break it down, and in the lyrics of the music, ask students what problem was Drake trying to solve? Which
students have fun with as they create their own own answers (he's trying to solve his loneliness, lack of love,
insecurities etc). This puts students prior experience and knolwedge front and center in the learning experience. Then
through design thinking practices, we ask students to take a step back and identify problems in different levels on
their world. It could be in their family, school, community, country, world, so on, it could be different problems
depending on their age. We've heard of everything from gun violence, to bully, to depression, to suicide, to food
deserts, wanting to solve the crisis in Venezuela. We ask students to identify a whole range of issues then ask them to
break that problem down - if they were to solve that problem, even if it is high level and abstract, break down that
problem into steps and sequences they would need to do to solve this problem. Then we ask students to define dance moves
or steps that illustrate or capture each one of the steps (in the solution). The students are ultimately making a viral
dance challenge that is solving the steps to the problem they have identified. That's using a critical lense to solve
problems using critical thinking skills. None of our dances have gone viral at this point, but we contextualize how the
viral dance challenge how a dance challenge becomes a dance challenge. So it's about composition and how technology
works: there is a dance, artists, someone recording, then that media is shared on a social media platform assoicated
with a hashtag, and the algorithms within ig and yt compile these media pieces that compile and display these pieces of
media. That's how the algorithms within these platforms are working and functioning - there are multiple levels of
perspectives that are decomposed and abstracted in these technological concept.

> ME:
# So you talk about algorithms while making the dance to introduce them to it,
# then you circle back and talk to them about alrogithms at the end of their
# production to talk about how their dance video is distributed on this platform -
# how algorithms and hastags work together to share this kind of stuff. Am i
# understanding correctly?

You got it. One of the facsinating things we've learned is that we partnered
with other coding organizations focused on coding and teaching coding to young
people, and one thing they struggle with is students can code and build what
they want in programming languages - but just because they can code, they can't
give a definition of an algorithm - they don't know what an alogrithm is. We've
been meeting with HR professionals, engineering folks who hire, for example one
of our advisors is a VP of a big engineering company in NY, and time and time
again to the people we talk to say that these coding bootcamps (general
assemble, apple academy, so on all these coding bootcamps that have developed to
meet the demands of the market) are developing coders who are sufficient in one
language (python, ruby), and they come out with the hard technical skills to
pull things off fast but have two major problems: the second they step out of
their scripting language their lost and second once you add critical problem
solving and innovation thinking, they're in deep water - they don't know how to
engage in that process. However they can get a specfic function to work in a
specific way becuase they are technically trained to execute the task at hand,
but the problem solving and analytical skills are completely void from those
experiences. We bring that whole ciritcal lense and perspective - not just the
how - how do you do this, but also the why and the what - what is this used for?
how can you use this in your community? It's a tool at the end of the day, and
so much at the end of these teaching programs is devoid of humanity even though
so much of it is user centered, like scrum. but it's user centered to create a
great experience for a monetary gain - its not to impact or change elements of
our society or critically analyze or have new perspective. It's not about that.

# Q: Can you tell me more about the - and this can be brief - the specifics at the
# organization you work with? Where are you working, who are you teaching, what
# ages?

I co-founded code society 2 years ago. My co founder is Jenith. We were former
colleagues at a non-profit org that has since fallen apart. We identified this
unique opportunity: 1 we established a strong and authentic relationship. We
created a creative education agency where we're using emmerging technology to
build an interactive learning experiences, using VR and AR for museums. Code
society started as a project within that creative agency. When we started
testing and engaging different spaces, we saw there was a high interest and need
for this lens of teaching in the tech space. We spun it out and formed an
independent entity around it: code society was incorporated in May. We've been
building it from scratch.

Our sweet spot is middle school and high school, looking at how do we cast a wider net for diverse learners to engage
and enter into this space. Ultimately our goal is to sell our product, our curriculum, media, content, so on to other
organizations. Our view is we are not trying to compete with other coding organizations - they're all doing great work -
but they're missing some key parts and we want to fill that void. We're trying to sell our curriculum to help coding
organizations engage a wider community of young people to bring them into their pipeline which provides students with
solid techincal knowledge. We want to address as well their attrition rate which is a huge problem for npo. We also work
with upper-elementary, like 5 to 6th grader which the students really enjoyed. We've also found that adults learners who
are exploring the possibility of going to a coding bootcamp and are interested in what our curriculum has to offer. Many
adults told us they learned so much from School house Rock, and if this is a school house rock for computer science -
where can I sign up?

# And where are you operating right now? Colorado?

I'm orginially from Denver, CO but I moved out to NY nearly a decade ago. We are based out of NYC. We have a instituion
here called the New Museum which we work under.

# Do you talk about a lot of different facets of critical pedagogy, one that I want to more about is around the
# relationship between the students and the teachers. Can you describe to me what kind of relationship they have?

Great question and this is a big question we're trying to answer. What we're trying to address is figure out how to
scale cp and maintian student-teacher relationships. Our backgrounds have been in program design, development,
administration, fundriasing and in the classroom itself. I'm not a licensed teacher but I have been in the classroom for
over 15 years teaching student arts based and technology based content. Something we find very interesting is we embody
this world view (critical perspective, cp, interpersonal aspect of how to build rapport in a classroom) and leverage
that to meet students where they are and open them up to the possibility of learning. We are experts of that, and do
that in a whole range of content. What we're trying to figure out is - there is a lot of control when we're in the
classroom, but even when we're there we find the relationship between students and teachers are deeply problematic and
dysfunctional. An example, and this is confidential, comes from the classroom management practices of the teacher with
the 4th and 5th graders. Firstly, there was a significant racial different. Both of the teachers were white, where as
all of their students were black or latinx. Secondly, the teachers weren't from NYC, they were from long island and
other places. There were already significant cultural barriers. The classroom management mirrored Pavlov's experiment
with the dog and ringing the bell. They had a bell that was supposed to be a call and response mechanism (like if you
can hear me clap once...) but they just rang this bell thinking students would calm down, or be attentive, or be back on
task. So this bell was constantly being rung in the classroom which we found was deeply problematic and fundamentally
contradictory to how we facilitate and create space for students. That posed an interesting question for us: if we are
baking in all these different elements that are rooted deeply in cp and pedagogy of the oppressed, as well as social and
emotional learning theories, how do we maintain the authenticity of that when we are not in the classroom? What we're
working on is what does it look like to do world and have avatars and characters in this universe through media that can
ultimately replace our selves and lend a critical perspective by adding those explicit voices in coded languages in a
way that resonates with teachers and supports teachers. While we have fundamental belief differences with so much of
education across this hemisphere, teachers are our allies and we are trying to figure out a way to engage and inspire
teachers in their own practice to bring in crp and cp into their practice. That is a great question that we are focusing
on. One of our strategies is build the software with the media that can replace us in the classroom and support teachers
and two: sell add-ons or other packages that offer professional development to teachers to train them in cp: shift from
teacher being at the center of the class to being on the side and facilitator of experience. That's interesting too
because so many teachers are intimidated by technology and cs. They feel like they don't know or can't teach it. And we
think, you don't have to teach it, you have to facilitate. That's part of the process and experience at the center of
what we're doing.

# I have a questions about engaging and incorporating students interests and experience in the curriculum and the
# teaching. I'm wondering: how do you go about engage these students interests and incorporating those in the pedagogy of
# your program?

Firstly, we are at code society are artists - from music (song writers, singers, djs) to performing to visual/digital
art, full spectrum of professional artists. We've worked together for the last several years and refined a hip-hop
pedagogy approach. We are deeply and authentically tapped in to youth culture at what is happening. We are very
intentional about asking students (through surveys, our pilots) what are you using? what are you listening to? what's
the latest meme you laughed at? how do you communicate this in an emoji? We're constantly asking those questions about
the digital world that young people are immersed in. we are then leveraging those trends, what's happened, and pulling
those into an educational context, using that as a translation mechanism for technical concepts. Example: in the context
of abstraction, a lot of students struggle with this. We leverage and use emojis as a form of abstraction, going all the
way down to binary. what are the different sequences inside of that, then we say how does ig or snapchat, what are
celebrities and celebrity profiles displaying? what are they not displaying? So how do we abstract - use different kinds
of elements and levels - and draw the correlation between compiling machines and mechanisms, and programming languages,
saying ultimately HTML displays this at the forefront. So it's like an abstracted relationship we use and leverage and
refence memes, emojis, all the things, you know, that are prominent in popular culture and youth culture. So hip hop is
a language and musical form - one of the critiques or questions we get is, great it's hip hop, but what is a student
doesn't like hiphop? We'll that's not the point, it's not rooted in hip hop. The musical choice and genre is hip hop,
but the learning experience is rooted in youth culture as a whole. Hip hop is inseparable from youth culture right now -
that's a fundamental connection. Whether someone is interested more in pop, or country, there is hip hop influence in
every single one of those genres. It's not about that - that's just a mechanism and transcendant beyond language and
culture, and is international in every sense of the word - but it's really tapping into the youth culture aspect - the
trends, the memes, and the things that are happening right now.

# I want to clarify to make sure I understand. Students create their own songs our dance routines that are related to
# problems or contradictions they see in their society at any level (from local to global issues). They think about
# these issues that afftect them and translate it and explain it through a media like a dance routine?

Yea, that's an example, it's not their entire model but it's an example. Creating a viral dance challenge in response to
a specific problem is one project based strategy within one single unit of instruction. We have a whole range of tactic
strategiges that are fundamentally project based that express a whole range of different things. We've had young people
create - actually spec out and wire-frame real solutions. We had young people a strategy game that communicate the
concept of abstraction. We had people create videos, press conferences, or music. One of the features we want to build
is that we create all the music and use that as the hook and the delivery mechanism for not only the critical
persepctive - because what we do in the music is also highlight underrepresented voices in this technology space,
including people of colour and their contributions to technology, we call them out in our lyrics bringing the critical
perspective in the music. So we create the music and that's the hook and delivery mechanism for so much of the content,
but a feature we're building in software/figuring out how to do in a resource supported way is for students to remix our
music and create new verses. We're trying to figure out how we can create that in software, where students can create
and share their own works and creating a robust community of educators and students who are creating and sharing content
in this space. Educators can create their own lessons and share them on this platform and acrew value. Students can also
create their own responses and ways of teaching and learning certain cs concepts or problems and acrew value through
this space. We're looking at blockchain solutions where the value students create on this platform can be transfered to
other platforms, like Fornite for example where you can get a new avatar or outfit. This makes a learning environment where
you're learning these cs concepts and making value with your music and creations, then transferring to other platforms
for other forms of value. That's a little further down the road for us. We've also created a digital badge system where
students can accrue badges and share them on linkedin profiles - these are all parts of how we can articulate the
knowledge base students are learning and transfer that outside the environment we have. That's coming! But not here yet
at all.

# Just to clarify, this is an after school program?

This is a product itself. We sit outside of nonprofit. We are trying to step away from the direct services model and
employing our products in many different spaces as possible - after school, at integrated in class time, churches, and
community spaces. We are trying to provide out of box solutions for demands for meaningful CS education. This takes the
burden off of teachers to create these materials (especially if they don't have the content knowledge).

# So your struggles with maintaining student-teacher relationships is that you have no oversight of how the teachers
# using your products and teaching students, right?

Yes, we don't have authority over teachers.

# We're at the end of our time now - is there any questions you would like to ask me or anything you would like to
# tell me?

I'm super interested in your research, what you see long term, and your conversation. What I would to see is creating a
community of folks to engage and connect. If you're interviewing other folks in the intersection of CP and CS we would
love to connect with them to collaborate, explore, and discuss. We love talking about this and engaging in
this. Otherwise thank you for doing this research and stepping into this space which has a lot of resistance and lack of
knowledge about CP.
