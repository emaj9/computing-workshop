cold call

Hi all,

We are seeking canditates to interview as part of our research to understand how self-described critical pedagogues
implement critical pedagogy in their teaching. Our research question is: beyond rhetoric, how do educators implement critical pedagogy in
their teaching?

Interviews will last roughly an hour and will be very informal. We are looking for concrete examples of critical
pedagogy in computer science
