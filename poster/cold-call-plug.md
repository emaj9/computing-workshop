Hello,


we are Eric and Jake, McGill students. We are running a free workshop on machine learning that address how machine learning algorithms work and the ethics of machine learning in a safe learning environment. Our workshop uses evidence based pedagogical practices that have been shown to improve learning outcomes and engagement in students, particularly for marginalized or under represented students.


We are writing to ask you to distribute within your network the following flyer with the details of our workshop. We are asking your organization and others that work with under represented groups in computer science because we want to provide equal opportunity to those who generally don't benefit from the traditional teaching methods for computer science.


Thank you for considering our request.


Eric and Jake
