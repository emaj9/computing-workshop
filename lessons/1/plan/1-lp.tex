\section*{Overview}

\begin{description}
  \item[Lesson Objectives] ~

   By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the function of the power supply unit in the computer.

    \item Build basic logic gates out of transistors, both theoretically and
      physically on a breadboard.

    \item Draw the logic gate diagram corresponding to a circuit on a
      breadboard.

    \item Name a few basic Haskell types and use an interactive Haskell prompt
      like GHCi.
  \end{itemize}

  \item [Materials]~

    To run this lesson, the following are needed:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        lesson slides;

        \url{\cwurl 1-slides.pdf}

      \item
        logic gate review worksheet;

        \url{\cwurl 1-ws-gate-review.pdf}

      \item
        circuit diagrams and boolean logic worksheet;

        \url{\cwurl 1-ws-circuit.pdf}

      \item
        one breadboard for each group and enough of the following electronic
        components:
        NPN transistors,
        100~$\Omega$ resistors,
        9~V batteries,
        5~V power regulators,
        jumper wires of various lengths or ribbon cables,
        and assorted LEDs.

    \end{itemize}

\section*{Instructional Sequence}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[5 mins.]
    Facilitators welcome the group and present lesson agenda.

  \item[20 mins.]
    Using the slides, facilitators will present the power supply unit, binary
    numbers, and logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).

  \item[40 mins.]
    Students will complete the ``Circuit diagrams and boolean logic''
    worksheet.
    Each group will receive two copies of the worksheet and the worksheet is to
    be completed in pairs.

    The final component of the worksheet involves a larger group activity, so
    it should be completed in groups of four.

  \item[25 mins.]
    The rest of the class will introduce Haskell and programming languages. To
    tie in pre-existing knowledge of hardware, students will understand
    compilation to be moving down the latter of abstraction. Participants are
    now prepared to complete the \url{www.tryhaskell.org} by the next session.
