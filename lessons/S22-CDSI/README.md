## Structure

Morning sesh: 10 - 12
Lunch: 12 - 13
Afternoon sesh: 13 - 15

Group discord server for distributing links, handouts, announcements!

- At end of each sesh have students right one thing they learned on a
  whiteboard.

## Monday: Welcome! Algorithms, types, values, expressions.

### Morning

50 mins:

- Land acknowledgement activity
- Icebreaker
- Syllabus overview

70 mins:

- lecture & discussion: what are algorithms?
  - examples of 'real-life' algorithms:
    - base-10 'school' arithmetic
    - cooking recipes
    - tax forms
    - commuting (go here; if I see the bus, take it; otherwise walk to the
      metro)
  - machine learning algorithms?
- lecture: ints, floats, strings; expressions and values; evaluation
- worksheet on expressions and evaluation (CW W19 lesson 1)
  using repl.it

### Afternoon

60 mins:
- running code on your computer: setting up Python (anaconda)
- exercise: coding bat warmup 1 while we circulate to set up everyone.

rest:
- lecture: variables

## Tuesday: conditions, loops, functions

### Morning

- types and values recap:
  - DIY parsons problem:
    last line is `print(a)`; in pairs.
    Student A makes up a 4-line program and scrambes it. They give the expected
    output.
    Student B unscrambes to produce the expected output. 
- lecture: conditions and statements
- coding bats on conditions
- lecture: loops
- coding bats on loops

### Afternoon

- functions
- game: uno -- very scaffolded worksheet guiding:
- rendering technical:
  - turning the description of the game into code
  - did we leave anything out?
  - is our implementation faithful to the IRL game?

## Wednesday: the environment

### Morning

The environment:
- stdin / stdout
- the terminal: command-line arguments, environment variables
- (BIG) data
- file IO
- UNIX philosophy: everything is a file

- machine learning algorithms group activity (CW ML 0)

### Afternoon

- wordle:
  - activity: write down all the 5-letter words you can into a google doc
  - loading word list from file
  - coding wordle: scaffolded with worksheet, but less than UNO

## Thursday: dictionaries & data structures

Jake away for endocrinology appt

### Morning

- dict lmao
- representing a _graph_ with dictionaries

### Afternoon

- irish immigration exercise

## Friday: Intro data science - NumPy, saving/loading data, plotting

- [numpy basics](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html)
- [sklearn KNN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html)

### Morning

- loading data into numpy
- visualizing data with matplotlib
- calculating statistics with numpy
- using out-of-the-box ML algos with sklearn

### Afternoon

- stupid AI
- AI ethics: recidivism prediction, facial recognition
