\section*{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  What is the interpretation of the colors in the tree visualization?
  \vspace{2em}

\item
  In each node, what is the relationship between the counts in the
  \texttt{value} list and \texttt{samples}?
  \vspace{2em}

\item
  Notice that in all the teal and purple nodes, the first count in
  \texttt{value} is always zero. Why is that?
  \vspace{2em}

\item
  What is the interpretation of the \texttt{value} entry in each node?
  \vspace{2em}

\item
  Invent three data points.
  Choose feature values so that the first point falls into the orange leaf; the
  second, into the teal leaf; and the third, into the most purple leaf. Recall
  that leaves are nodes with no children.
  For example, a point with ``petal width = $2.0$'' would follow the False
  branch of the root node. Choose the other parameters so that the point arrives
  at the desired classification.
