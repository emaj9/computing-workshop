Our pedagogical practices
=========================

This page outlines the teaching philosophy and pedagogical research used in our teaching and planning at Computing
Workshop.

### Teaching philosophy

At Computing Workshop, we aim to minimize teacher-centered learning pedagogy (like lectures) in favour of group work
and co-constructing knowledge with participants. In order to movtivate learning and engage participants, we ask
participants in their registration what they want to learn about and make that the focus of the module we'll do
together. Once the participants tell us what they want to learn about, out job is to find create pedagogical techniques to encourage
participation and learning that are also backed by research and evidence of efficacy. Listed below are some of the
resesarch that influences our teaching practices at Computing Workshop and why.

### Peer instruction

Peer instruction (PI) is a common student-centered form of pedagogy slowly taking root in university STEM programs. PI
follows the following steps:

1. Instructor poses a difficult question based on students' prior knowledge
2. Students reflect on the question
3. Students commit to an individual answer (often through voting)
4. Instructor reviews student responses
5. Students discuss their thinking and answers with their peers
6. Students then commit again to an individual answer
7. The instructor again reviews responses and decides whether more explanation is needed before moving on to the next concept.

This pedagogical technique has shown to be very powerful in computer science ..

### POGIL

POGIL (peer oriented guided inquiry learning)

### Pair programming

Pair programming is a pedagogical technique where students work in pairs while coding, only using one laptop between the
two of them. One student is the "drier", they use the computer and write the code, while the other student is the "???"
