May  14th - mock interview
--------------------------

2. where did you first learn about cp?
re: when i was a grad student taking courses oyse - at u of t
**added**: what was your first reponse -> i felt i was the problem - i had been teaching for a banking model
-> don't ask leading questions, sjust ask what was you first impression

4. **how do you implement your understanding cp in your classes?**
--long answer
re: i don't think i have, certain things associated: teach cs 1 -> uses contextualized projects, has a week - 3 with
student directed classes voting on student topics and interests!, menu of options to choose from (with a brief
description),
    **added question: are there any other ways you partially implement cp?**
    - do a lot of surveying students -> weekly feedback process (mycourses), give them credit
    - makes mistakes in fron tof class a lot ->
    - counter to cp: set myself as an authority. as a young woman i'm not seen as an authority by my
      students. complicated dance of presenting myself increasing social distance while being approachable. a lot easier
      for an old white guy.
    **added question: more pointed questions: did you teach about oppression? power? socipoitical?**
    - i felt nervous implementing social stuff -? expectations of teacher evaluations from students being very negative
      -> "she's too poolitical" this thereatens tenure tracka nd their stuff- > system incentivizing away from that
    - your responsibility in society. if you write code that hurts people, i will take time to tlak about this.
    - bring in quest lectureres that have status they wont get as questioned. -> using other as more authorotative,
      learn what i want you to learn that won't absorb form me

5. **how has the way you taught changed as a result of cp?**
-> redundant!!!

5. **what is needed for a successful cp class/lesson?**
one question at a time!!
re: academic freedom, job security. if you talk about political structures of cs and not get fired.
student evaluations of teaching are not the only form of evaluation: trying to teach students politics matter and
sometimes they're not ready to talk about this. job perfomrance rewards doing what you think is best for the students.
- forgiveness to yourself you're not going to do it all
  - teaching assistants and support. projects with open ended qurstions requires a lot of marking - when you have 1--
    students in your class. you don't need nay TA - you need prepared tas to deal with these questions. ta's just want a
    right answers! these tas are usually trying to climb to the top of the system. time training ta's.
- admin support: if some students relalyl go out of the way to get at you - you need your chair to be helping you and
  supporting you


**added question: what don't you implement for cp?**
- i don't feel like i do enough consciousness raising
- i'm teaching 100s of students, i dont have relationships with them
- one on one relationship necessary for cp - you don't get that in cs.
- contradiction of how i position myself -> authority not on the same playing field
- you need to learn about politics- its' good for you

6. **what were you not expecting when implmenet cp in your xp?**
the degree of student resistance. to a lot of students, cs is apolitical - i'm here to learn how to code not
politics. they don't engage with it and don't care. i'm putting in what i think they should learn about.

9. **describe a really successful cp class/lesson?** -> go neutral. not "best", just any
first one to come to mind: students wanted to learn about how the internet works -> broke up song lyrics and apread them
across the class -> friday by rebecca black, meme-type songs. good vibe: students wants to learn about, everyone was
engaged, no question sabout it on the final so i don't know how much tey learned.
**add** digging deeper-> what about socio-political successful traditional CS class? what's a successful one?
    - one class spend the whole class on it -> bringing it in 5 minutes at a time, applying context and this. more in
      passing than an entire lecture in -> post political acticles online, assiggment where students did a forest fire
      simulation -> climate change

**how do you talk about sociopolitical context in your teaching?**

**how do you teach raising consciousness? if no -> why not?**
- never felt equipped to do it while i was at toronto
  what would you need to feel equipped? a police force that protects

**have you ever had an students change their world and their society? word this better**
- had an open ended project. some would create things that were like making an alarm clock for myself. maybe doesn't
  remember

~~8. to someone looking to teach a cs class with cp, what advice would you give them?~~

May 9th
-------

notes with elizabeth meeting, over phone

sure there are ppl using elems of cp, like cs for social good -- using cp but not
knowing!! finding the researches -- as michael goldweber to find these kinds of
papers.

1 project: classification system of literature
another: talking to people about what they're doing - might be more interesting
project
    - if you were a reporter askign about professors pedagogy - you don't need
      ethics to do that! although jounralists have their own set of ethis
    - don't worry about research ethics yet - don't let it get in the way
    - imagine reporter - what questions would you be asking?
    - 5 to 10 questions - first work on them together - then roleplay!! then
      role play the other way around. roleplaying is good!
    - objective: looking at practioners how are they implementing
    - what elements of critical pedagogy are they implementing?
    - not the critical pedagogy master will implement it
    - suggest i do: brainstorm of lists (rough) of what are the elements of cp
      that i see -
    - for next time expecting: draft list of questions, and a draft list of
      elements of critical pedagogy
