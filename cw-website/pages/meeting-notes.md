notes with elizabeth meeting, over phone

sure there are ppl using elems of cp, like cs for social good -- using cp but not
knowing!! finding the researches -- as michael goldweber to find these kinds of
papers.

1 project: classification system of literature
another: talking to people about what they're doing - might be more interesting
project
    - if you were a reporter askign about professors pedagogy - you don't need
      ethics to do that! although jounralists have their own set of ethis
    - don't worry about research ethics yet - don't let it get in the way
    - imagine reporter - what questions would you be asking?
    - 5 to 10 questions - first work on them together - then roleplay!! then
      role play the other way around. roleplaying is good!
    - objective: looking at practioners how are they implementing
    - what elements of critical pedagogy are they implementing?
    - not the critical pedagogy master will implement it
    - suggest i do: brainstorm of lists (rough) of what are the elements of cp
      that i see -
    - for next time expecting: draft list of questions, and a draft list of
      elements of critical pedagogy
