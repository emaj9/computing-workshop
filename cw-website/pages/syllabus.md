Workshop Description
--------------------
Computing Workshop is a 10 session workshop designed to help people understand how computers and websties work. This workshop will cover hardware, software, and web development to individuals with little to no background in computers using cooperative, problem-based learning methods. Each class is 1.5 hours long and has an estimated 1 hour worth of homework that accompanies each lesson.

Workshop Rationale
------------------
We created this workshop to provide people with the support to feel comfortable using a computer. Techonology is pervasive in our society, but rarely are individuals provided with meaningful education in how to use it. Our workshop looks to activate participant's motivation by providing them with hands on, interactive lessons covering fundamental knowledge with respect to computers. This workshop uses a co-constructivist teaching approach to help our participants develop their own tools and understanding of computers.

Learning Goals
==============

By the end of the workshop, students wil be able to:

###Computers

  * 0 identify hardware components and their function;
  * identify core services provided by an operating system;
  * identify how the operating system manages resources;
  * 0 identify the boundaries and relationships between application,
    operating system, and hardware;
  * define what a program is;
  * explain the process of downloading a resource from a remote host;
  * explain the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in displaying a web page in a browser;
  * categorize different networking protocols (application vs. hardware);
  * break down the process from computer poweron to operating system startup.
  * Interact with github, value online commmunities, value and respect open source matierial 
  * Navigate online resources and take autonomy of their own learning

###Programming

  * Translate a world problem into code: - identify key types, writing algorithm 
  * Use haskell as a calculator
  * Run haskell programs using dependencies
  * Differentiate between values, types, types classes, and kind
  * Type check expression
  * Implement and use higher order functions (and partial applications)
  * Can use IO monad to create interactive programs
  * Can identify types that are functors
  * Use do notation for a variety of monads (Maybe, Either a, so on...)
  * Create a static site generator to create a website

###Web Dev

  * 0 Conceptualize a website and then create it
  * Characterize the historic trends in web dev
  * Create aethestics websites using golden ratio, negative space, colour theory
  * Use appropriate elements of HTML - hamburger text markup language
  * Use Flexbox to make reponsibe websites
  * Use appropriate CSS selectors and rules
  * Building reusable web components,
  * Use Javascript to: modify the dom, make http requests
  * Navigate the Hakyll library to generate a static website
