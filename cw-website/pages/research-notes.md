interview questions
-------------------

grand tour question
-------------------
next time:
checklists!!! of both

thursday or next tuesday

finding people -> doing ethics first

make the questions targetting and close with checklist
without ethics don't push it
bring up what do you not include in cp?
*semi-structure*
1. what is your understanding of cp?
   a. (prompt) what is not
   b. when did you learn about cp?
2. all your cs teaching xp
3. for each of those, how has cp influenced/informed your teaching?
4. prompt/follow up: ask pointed questions about pillars of cp. what have they chosen what haven'y they chosen
   - non-confrontational; do you do anything with [thing missing]? why not?

what should i add to this:
    keep it towards the how it plays out in your classroom
    questions about why haven't you done x -> more likely to steer into ethics territory

follow up study: ppl who are already implementing it and don't know. requires a checklist, survey form

re:style of teaching assoc with fiere, and others. about: empowering students and rasigin critical consciousness in
their world

early question: your teaching experience -> where have you been a teacher? list all the forms you've taught.
then questions: for each of these: did you have anything related to cp?


2. where did you first learn about cp?
re: when i was a grad student taking courses oyse - at u of t
**added**: what was your first reponse -> i felt i was the problem - i had been teaching for a banking model
-> don't ask leading questions, sjust ask what was you first impression

4. **how do you implement your understanding cp in your classes?**
--long answer
re: i don't think i have, certain things associated: teach cs 1 -> uses contextualized projects, has a week - 3 with
student directed classes voting on student topics and interests!, menu of options to choose from (with a brief
description),
    **added question: are there any other ways you partially implement cp?**
    - do a lot of surveying students -> weekly feedback process (mycourses), give them credit
    - makes mistakes in fron tof class a lot ->
    - counter to cp: set myself as an authority. as a young woman i'm not seen as an authority by my
      students. complicated dance of presenting myself increasing social distance while being approachable. a lot easier
      for an old white guy.
    **added question: more pointed questions: did you teach about oppression? power? socipoitical?**
    - i felt nervous implementing social stuff -? expectations of teacher evaluations from students being very negative
      -> "she's too poolitical" this thereatens tenure tracka nd their stuff- > system incentivizing away from that
    - your responsibility in society. if you write code that hurts people, i will take time to tlak about this.
    - bring in quest lectureres that have status they wont get as questioned. -> using other as more authorotative,
      learn what i want you to learn that won't absorb form me

5. **how has the way you taught changed as a result of cp?**
-> redundant!!!

5. **what is needed for a successful cp class/lesson?**
one question at a time!!
re: academic freedom, job security. if you talk about political structures of cs and not get fired.
student evaluations of teaching are not the only form of evaluation: trying to teach students politics matter and
sometimes they're not ready to talk about this. job perfomrance rewards doing what you think is best for the students.
- forgiveness to yourself you're not going to do it all
  - teaching assistants and support. projects with open ended qurstions requires a lot of marking - when you have 1--
    students in your class. you don't need nay TA - you need prepared tas to deal with these questions. ta's just want a
    right answers! these tas are usually trying to climb to the top of the system. time training ta's.
- admin support: if some students relalyl go out of the way to get at you - you need your chair to be helping you and
  supporting you


**added question: what don't you implement for cp?**
- i don't feel like i do enough consciousness raising
- i'm teaching 100s of students, i dont have relationships with them
- one on one relationship necessary for cp - you don't get that in cs.
- contradiction of how i position myself -> authority not on the same playing field
- you need to learn about politics- its' good for you

6. **what were you not expecting when implmenet cp in your xp?**
the degree of student resistance. to a lot of students, cs is apolitical - i'm here to learn how to code not
politics. they don't engage with it and don't care. i'm putting in what i think they should learn about.

9. **describe a really successful cp class/lesson?** -> go neutral. not "best", just any
first one to come to mind: students wanted to learn about how the internet works -> broke up song lyrics and apread them
across the class -> friday by rebecca black, meme-type songs. good vibe: students wants to learn about, everyone was
engaged, no question sabout it on the final so i don't know how much tey learned.
**add** digging deeper-> what about socio-political successful traditional CS class? what's a successful one?
    - one class spend the whole class on it -> bringing it in 5 minutes at a time, applying context and this. more in
      passing than an entire lecture in -> post political acticles online, assiggment where students did a forest fire
      simulation -> climate change

**how do you talk about sociopolitical context in your teaching?**

**how do you teach raising consciousness? if no -> why not?**
- never felt equipped to do it while i was at toronto
  what would you need to feel equipped? a police force that protects

**have you ever had an students change their world and their society? word this better**
- had an open ended project. some would create things that were like making an alarm clock for myself. maybe doesn't
  remember

~~8. to someone looking to teach a cs class with cp, what advice would you give them?~~

elements of critical pedagogy:
------------------------------
**Critical Consciousness**
steps to critical pedagogy (around pages 100s)

-> seems abstract - break it down
-> likert questionnaire

1. raising awareness and investigation

- students have many hurdles to face, like internalized oppression
  1. first job is to understand forms of oppression in lived reality of students through **dialogue** with students
  2. student previeced or actual oppression for student (in discussion)
  3.
- the dialogue looks to find the structures of oppressioned through the **student's** lived experiences
  - "The starting point for organizing the program content of education
    or political action must be the present, existential, concrete situ­
    ation, reflecting the aspirations of the people."
  - dialogue is of course in the language of the students
  - also requires a reflection on ppls thinking -> catch internalized oppression

2. finding generative themes

- objectifying the world, connecting people's lived experiences to understand the reality of society
  - looking for: themes, patterns, contradictions, problems in society
- decoding can be used to help identify themes that are harder to see - this makes me think of like coded racial
  language in politics (ex. "tough on crime", "clean up the streets" -> coded race, to look like a potential president
  -> coded gender) look at p 114
- these themes are established by the students (its their lived experience after all) and becomes the focus of study

3. problematize and act

- looking at the issues and theme presented in the investigation and finding solutions that could fix it as well as
  consequences for choices
- finally the students create a solution that works to solve the issue by transforming reality with students and teacher
- cnx to cs readings: students developing software that addresses their issue they found
  - i suppose a lot of learning cs content knowledge happens here, thru design and implementation

**other features**
acknowledging and breaking down the power structures in the class
    => be upfront of authority as a teacher
    => make the class a more even playing field between teacher and student
    => teacher's don't act like they know everything, explore content with the students - break down


responsibility of the teacher:
    - guide inquiry though the content
    - support students in identifying genereative themes, decoding
    - facilitate student's learning process

student directed, student responsive

### Computer Science Education for Social Good
m goldweber & elizabeth! 2013

1. Orientation
    a. this paper talks about "social good" - maybe that's realted to cp? after
    all cp is about improving society
    b. intro to computing for the social good - what is it all about? where can
    i learn more about this idea? and ideally connect to my understanding of cp
    c. read it all and read the references

2. Summary

### How can digital inclusion promote social change? Exploring two Brazilian case studies
Sammia Poveda 2016

1. Orientation
    a. in the search of reading all things cs ed + cp, this is on the list. it
    refernces cp directly.
    b. how they used cp in teaching cs, as well as what is their definition of cp?
    c. read a bit of the background to see how they taught cs critically and the
    results comparing cp insturction to dialect instruction

2. Summary
    a. This article explores the results (and benefits) of using a critical pedagogy approach
    in teaching ICT use over traditional pedagogy.
    b. This enters into a converstion about inequality in Brazil and around ICT
    use and knowledge globally, focusing on what interventions are effective and
    useful for people
    c. education researchers, people who care about inequality around tech

3. Assessment
    a. 2 kinds of data collection: first - longitudinal design, collecting data
    at the beginning and end of the courses, using interviews, questionnaires,
    and observations. second: the organization, their objects, and their
    activities. indterviews of staff and participant observation.
    b. this article is credible in that it uses a lot of data to come to it's
    conclusions. If anything tho, I'm less sure what "critical pedagogy" means
    and sometimes feel like this paper is using the term incorrectly. namely,
    they mention how students share their experience of discrimination during a
    typing exercise but is that really helping them understand the underlying
    causes of racism? It's good that they are sharing and discussing but it
    seems like only the starting point of conscietization
    c. facilitators, staff, participants, community members. all around good!

4. Use
    a. emphasis on staying practical is important for me. also being very
    privileged and in canada adds more distance between understanding the
    Brazilian experience of poverty
    b. Implications for me point to how effective cp can be when teaching cs and
    how it should be used more often. for me, this makes me wonder: what is cp
    in cs? so far i've seen bits and pieces of freire's vision but never a
    complete picture of critical pedagogy, and other research suggests it's not
    even possible!
    c. yes!

notes:

- study uses capability approach and cp frameworks
- brazil still very inequal, especially in the world of ICT (who has it, who
  knows how to use it)
- research question: is appluing Freire's pedagogy better at promoting
  devlopment and social change than other traitional approaches?
- collected data form 2 different courses with difference instructional methods
  (one cp the other traditional)
- course benefited students because it just gave them something to do. a lot of
  evidence points to the fact the area the study was done in didn't have much
  for students to do on their own time
- ict useful to participants as they could contant others, as well as find
  services useful to them p 6
- use of cp: in teaching typing, participants were given a story about a man
  being discriminated against to type out - two birds one stone kinda
      - this raised awareness about race, and soon other participants were
        engaging in a dialogue about how they were discriminated against and why
        it was wrong. -> promotes conscientisation
      - compared to the "traditional" pedagogy approach, none of this was
        mentioned in their typing class
- cp approach talked about social media and facebook, including social issues
  like how to be safe - i'm disappointed there is no mention about privacy
  concerns and would have been a perfect opportunity to talk about this p7
- exploring gvt resources: cp approach taught how to be more engaged as a
  citizen
- liberating: one participants in cp approach talked about being free from being
  a mother for a while while learning about computers. very nice!
- in cp appraoch: participants used computers and gvt websites to enact change
  in their communities (cleaning local park ex p 7)

### Travels in Troy with Freire
Blikstein 2008

1. Orientation:
    a. how does critical pedagogy relate to computer science and cs ed?
    b. skim to look for what I need, namely how freire relates to cs
    c. avoid background on freire

2. Summary
    a. school based implementations of freirean pedagogy should be interpreted
    not as curiosities but as viable alternatives to prevalent pedagogy.
    b. this piece enters the conversation about cp and how it related to
    tech. it reiterates the use and power of cp especially for oppressed groups.
    c. education researchers, particularly theory people and critical theory ppl

3. Assessment
    a. author uses interviews, observations of the class to base his arguments
    on. this is adequit.
    b. it's credible to an extent. it's important to realize this is his one
    experience in teaching tech and seems like so much of the students were
    captivated by the sheer "new-ness" of the technology he brought in. i feel
    like that influenced the behaviour of the students a lot.
    c. everyone's: students, teachers, author. it would have been nice to hear
    more of the student voices though, i wonder if it was so successful for
    every student - did they all enjoy it and get something out of it?

4. Use
    a. i'm inclined to believe in critical pedagogy because i want to believe
    it's useful but at the same time I'm hesitant towards theories and how
    not-useful they can be in the classroom
    b. this shows a clear example how to use critical pedagogy in the class,
    even though it's not entirely clear what cp is. opens the door for more
    explorations of cp, its effectiveness, and ways to use it
    c. this did give me what i needed!

Notes:

- “proof of existence” that realizing the Freirean vision is possible even within the underprivileged settings that he
  was targeting and to reflect on some design principles that may be conducive to realizing his vision.
- intersectino of freire and constructionism
- goes to brazil, does a workshop on computers trying to be freire
- women less motivated in the class - now what? you can't force the students to work
- found something they were interested in (clay houses) and found a way to integrate tech without being heavy
  handed. resulted in them making a claymation - so cute!
- technology, and particularly the design of new digital devices, derived from math
and science are necessary tools for fulfilling Freire’s vision of humanization and
societal transformation.
- teachers were resistant too - hard to break the role of "supervisor"
- initally students felt "lost" page 20
- "well intentioned educators can often be wrong about what matters to a
  specific community p 22
- technology is a tool of humanization. tech allows for creation, expression,
  and interaction -- all very human things!
- knowledge has no intrinsic value beyond culutral capital - bordieu
- this example of "cp" doesn't really do as much as i thought to consciou-ize
  the students, they didn't really do too much about their oppression IMO. cp is
  so scattered, who decides what is and isn't?

### Why Doesn't This Feel Empowering? Working Through the Repressive Myths of Critical Pedagogy
e ellsworth, 1990

1. Orientation:
    a. I'm reading this paper to get a fuller understanding of cp, namely its
    criticism
    b. what are the complaints about cp? how is it difficult to implement in the
    class? how might that affect the way cp was invisioned by freire?
    c. skim as always, look for criticism and understand them

2. Summary
    a. argues the "key assumptions, goals, and pedagogical practices fundamental
    to the literature on critical pedagogy [...] are repressive myths that
    perpetuate relations of domination." page 2
    b. this paper enters a conversation about critical pedagogy and its uses (or
    praxis). It brings these theoretical teaching philosophies into practice and
    emphasizes some of its short comings or blind spot
    c. educators, critical pedagoges, or critical theoritians (is that word?)

3. Assessment
    a. author bases argument off of her lived experience trying to implement a
    critical pedagogy approach to teaching racism
    b. its credible in that it's her experience and the claims she makes about
    using critical pedagogy are in valid and in the text itself. ultimately
    though this is just one experience of using critical pedagogy - there are
    other contexts where i think the issues she is raising aren't as a
    pronounced or as much of an issue.
    c. the professors points of view are prominent, and also sometimes the point
    of view of the students in her class are heard - if faintly. i'm thinking
    around the end when she mentions the student group that came out of the
    class.

4. Use
    a. usually i'm frustrated with theories when it comes to teaching because
    sometimes it feels like it is not very helpful for teaching - so i'm more
    inclined to believe the criticism of theories
    b. this paper really shines a light on the challenges of teaching with
    critical pedagogy and expands the conversation on how cp and be improved and
    changed
    c. i did get what i want - mostly - must re read this to get it all though

notes:

- ellsworth teaches a class on racism after racist incident at her uni
- argues the "key assumptions, goals, and pedagogical practices fundamental to
  the literature on critical pedagogy [...] are repressive myths that perpetuate
  relations of domination." page 2
- no clear idea what critical ed is (footnote 10)
- crticial pedagogy is about coming to a "rational" conclusion - but what even
  is "rational"? page 9
- theorists of cp haven't launched any meningful analysis of or program for
  reforming the institutionalized power imbalances between themselves and their
  students - page 10 so real and scathing!
- "emancipatory authority" page 11
- no teacher is free from internalize oppressions & no oppressed group is immune
  from reporducing oppressive narratives p 12
- cp says teacher knows material better than students - but how can a white
  teacher know oppression better than a teacher of colour? also the idea a
  teacher can "know all" - how is that? thinking about opression page 14
- cp seems to be about "helping" ppl of colour page 13
- affiliation with student movements and power: brought to the classroom
privileges and interests that were put at risk in fundamental ways by the
demands and defiances of student voices. page 13
- reading the second half got more and more challenging - return to this

### Ethics Education in Context: A Case Study of Novel Ethics Activities for the CS Classroom
m. Skirpan 2018

1. Orientation:
    a. I'm reading this paper to get an idea where ethics is in cs ed, how it can
    be integrated meaningfully, and how (or if) it connects to cp
    b. how to teach ethics in cs - is it successful? how does it look compared to
    cp?
    c. read the background looking for a window into cs ethics education (maybe i'm
    better of looking at that on its own...) found out their methods and framework

2. Summary:
    a. This paper reports on a cs class that integrated ethics in a way that was
    engaging and meaningful for students. Engaging cs students in ethics is
    traditionally challenging
    b. this paper is entering into the conversation about engaging cs students in
    ethics in a way that is authentic for the students. several studies cited in
    this paper discuss how ethics is either not covered or not covered in a
    meaningful way for students.
    c. education cs researchers

3. Assessment:
    a. the evidence comes from collections of the students work in the class, as
    well as a survey (post)
    b. this is a good source to base their ideas off of. being they were teachers,
    this might make the conclusion and data a little less credible (ex. students
    want to be polite to their teacher) but i don't think its a concern to the main
    point of the paper.
    c. the students pov is closely integrated in the paper which is nice, as well as
    the teachers. that's all that's needed i think

4. Use:
    b. implications are how to teach ethics successful, avoiding some of the pit
    falls outlined by the cited research. for me it shows the importance of well
    crafted activities in learning.
    c. i got what i needed - critical pedagogy != ethics! although it could easily...

notes:

- ethics is integrated into the class, instead of a stand alone topic. makes me
  think of sepehr and his vision for cs ed
- ok ppl know teaching cs ethics is important and issue
- if ethics isn't integrated more closely with course it can be seen as a "side
  issue" according to some paper cited in this paper
- this paper did a course, intensive summer course, on human-centered computing
  foundations course. focuses on human aspect of computer systems, like
  accessibility and consequences of design choices,
- half lecture, half lab time
- yea this isn't much like critical pedagogy, but there is some sort of
  connection. adding in "real world problems" according to the author helped
  with engagement (see discussion).

### Game Jams as a Space to Tackle Social Issues: an Approach Based on the Critical Pedagogy
Christina Myers 2018

1. Orientation:
    a. I'm reading this paper because its one of the few papers in the acm librar
    that explicitly talks about cp, as well as being the best paper for 2018
    b. I want to see how they apply critical pedagogy to a learning environment i
    CS
    c. avoid the background on freire, look at the methods, restuls, and conclusion

2. Summary:
    a. the article pilots a game jam using critical pedagogy framework to engage
    participants to create a game that is critical and meaningful for the participants
    b. the paper is entering into a conversation about teaching and working with
    diverse people in computer science? mainly theoretical frameworks to use when
    teaching, and how critical pedagogy is and can be successful to working with
    diverse students
    c. education cs researchers

3. Assessment:
    a. the evidence on the trail comes from a questionnaire given to participants
    of the study. theory is grounded in well theory
    b. i can't really judge the evidence because i don't understand the stats that
    well. otherwise the questionnaire seems good and comprehensive.
    c. the points of view of the participants are considered. that's all that's
    necessary i believe

4. Use:
    a. i have a bias towards cp and thinking its a good theoretical framework to
    work off of
    b. implications show the successes and uses of critical pedagogy which i really
    like! for myself, this is a great model for using cp in cs ed and makes me atune
    to what to look for
    c. i got what i wanted yes!

Notes:

- simlarities in game jams and critical pedagogy make them a nice fit together:
  freedom, team work, empowerment.
- method: they used the critical pedagogy "steps" (investigation ->
  thematisation -> problematozatopm => systematisation) to work with the game
  jam ppl.
- participants were give cards to help understand the social issue (sexism in
  this case) and game mechanics!
- used participant questionnaires - results are in the results section but kinda
  confusing - will require a closer look
- doing something to fix and issue seems like a good way to bring ppl together
- sexism education cards were intentionally meant to touch on so many ways that
  sexism influences women's lives - helped reinforce the point and make sense of
  it all
- These results seem to confirm that variances on level of interest influenced
  learning and perceptions of the usefulness of such cards to trigger
  discussion. page 7
  - critical pedagogy isn't enough - stimulating interest is important. i guess
    in this case, participants didn't pick their own interest, they were told it
    would be on sexism
- "reflections on the designers' lived experiences can be used to induce
  learning." critical pedagogy in a nutshell p 8

### Ethics, Identity, and Political Vision: Toward a Justice-Centered Approach to Equity in Computer Science Education
Sepehr Vakil 2018

1. Orientation:
    a. What is Sepehr's idea about social justice and teaching computer science?
    how is social justice related to more equitable cs ed? is social justice a
    required element in social justice conversations?
    b. the main argument of the author and how he came to this idea.
    c. read it - avoid the background info that i already know.

2. Summary:
    a. In this article I use critical pedagogy and critical race theory (Freire, 2000;
    Giroux, 1989; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995) to argue that linking the need
    for CS in schools to the interests of multinational corporations obscures the
    sociopolitical implications, relevance, and, ultimately, liberatory possibilities
    of teaching and learning CS.
    b. The conversation is about how CS is taught and its role in society. Right now, the dominant approach, isn't including
    the political and ethical dimension of tech nor the students' political identities. Adding these, will increase the
    quality of education and diversity
    c. education researchers, practioners

3. Assessment:
    a. evidence is solid. Theory is based in big players (Grioux, Freire), analyzes curriculum (ECS, CSTA), and
    includes an interview with a student. All very solid!
    b. see above
    c. Includes pov of 1 student, and the ideas put forth by policy makers. missing: a discussion with teachers would be
    nice. maybe their experience with critical pedagogy, their concerns, what they need to implement cp

4. Use:
    a. My experience teaching cs and including the political dimension makes me more open to this kind of research. my bias
    is to include these things but i also have limitations. not really being a person of colour being oppressed (esp by
    tech) makes it harder for me to relate.
    b. this opens a door for ppl to student more cp in cs. it's a good push forward that opens a lot of questions and paths
    for new research, as well as paths to make critical pedagogy more prominent in cs ed.
    c. yes!

Notes:

- cs is becoming big in k-12, look at page 2
- questions: what are the goals and values of cs ed? how does this shape cs ed
  (curriculum and pedagogy)?
- premise of sepehr argument: cs has large implications and deeply connected to
  many dimensions of life, particularly human and lives experiences
- citations on how poc and underrepresented groups are kept out of cs, sometimes
  thru bad teaching, or no resources
- computer science teachers association: talks a bit about ethics in teaching cs
  to high schoolers. discussion of ethics sucks, and is ahistorical, apolitical
- even ECS (exploring computer science) talks about ethics but still very
  individually, like if buying pirated dvds is ok lol
- identity: cs ed still very focsued on the cognitive ability of students and
  not very critical (considering what students already know). This dates back to
  Seymour papert and LOGO.
- vision for cs ed: started wishful and imaginative, emancipatory even but
  recently has become about meeting the needs of industry, and even
  "security". security is an ideological construct critiqued a lot even by
  chomsky!
- justice centered approach over dominant approach. Some key differences between the two: dom - students are encouraged
  to be responsibile digital citizens & justice - engages students in critique of unethical abuses of tech power - dom:
  learn tech to get jobs v. justice: tech can push for social change.
- knowledge is political
- critical pedagogy ex: explore the technicalities of something (cryptography) and its political history (done by nazis)
  or its use right now in controlling and public, or current events!
- incorporate students political identities: not party politics but their commitment to issues of power and inequality -
  teach them using cs to help them with their cause - "untapped resource in transformative learning"
- uses student case studies page 16


### Engineering Equity: A Critical Pedagogical Approach to Language and Curriculum Change for African American Males in STEM
Chapter in: Human Rights in Language and STEM Education, 55–70. 2016
JABARI MAHIRI AND JEREMIAH SIMS

1. Orientation
    a. I'm reading this paper to see how CP is implemented in STEM classes,
    espcially the effects it has on people of colour. What are their experiences?
    What does the research say this can do for ppl of colour?
    b. Get an idea of CP with CS. Examine their method - how did they guage their
    success? What are their references, can that point me to more research on CP
    with minorities?
    c. Glance at the intro - any thinkers I didn't see? Look at the methods and
    bibliography. Read the Abstract and zone in on what I want.

2. Summary
    a. the paper studied how critical pedagogy approaches worked with black
    students in the states learning stem, and the results were very positive and
    helpful for the students. Yay!
    b. the conversation is about the low achievement of black students in general
    for education in the states but especially in computer science. what are the
    causes of this discrepency? what can be done to improve it?
    c. teachers looking to help this situation, education reseachers? policy makers
    who care?

3. Assessment
    a. low achievement for black students backed up with statistics from us
    bureau. pedagogy grounded in theory and a lot of recent studies. their findigns
    as a result of notes and observations, surveys, interviews. this is all pretty
    credible!
    b. see above
    c. the points of view of students and teachers are included in this which i
    appreciate. maybe parents and community members could have been more involved?

4. Use
    a. my bias towards practical application and my lack of knowledge in general
    changes my assessment of this paper. also being white i don't fully understand
    the experience of black ppl in the states with cs
    b. shows the potential for critical pedagogy and how it can be a critical
    solution to problems in education and the workforce. changes for me too because
    it clearly illustrates what cp looks like cs
    c. this paper did provide what i wanted!


Notes:

- ran an afterschool program (MAN UP) twice a month. Focused on math, cs, and
  rhetorical analysis of manhood (ram). Ran pre and post surveys to see how it
  affected students part of the study.
- used critical pedagogy to make the teaching relevant and meaningful to
  students -> had social justice applications of stem.
- __main point__ : "The authors of this chapter decided to formally study the
  impact of this critical pedagogical approach for learning and making identity
  connections to STEM for the young African American male participants during
  the 2013–14 academic year.
- on culturally relevant pedagogy: Similarly, the central idea of culturally
  relevant pedagogy is that if learning structures and stimuli are grounded in a
  cultural-linguistic context that is familiar to students, there will be greater
  potential for cognitive expansion and knowledge growth (Allen & Boykin, 1992;
  Ladson-Billings, 1995)
- absorption model - linn and eylon (2011) used in science. No inquiry, go to
  lecture, do problems, and do step by step experiments
- collected data for the 2013 - 2014 cohort of 40 some students.
- before and after is so beautiful -
- class focused on positioning students as "applied STEM practioners".
- what they did: students for math made the equation for an insigna that they
  created of a mallet breaking thru a wall, a symbol of the students breaking
  stereotypes and showing they are malleable.
- cs: 8th graders made an app on environmental awareness.
- in teaching, math used a unit on healthy eating to crunch numbers - how much
  was healthy in terms of macronutrients? how did poverty affect this?
- app dev: students saw themselves as players in the game. they could help
  improve the environment and awareness.
- paper believes: critiques of the roles of STEM in the processes of oppression
must accompany considerations of the potential for STEM to be used to mitigate
oppression as part of the process for opening wider access to STEM as a civil and
human right.


### A Culturally Relevant Pedagogical Approach to Computer Science Education to Increase Participation of Underrepresented Populations
Timothy Yuen and others - 2016

1. Orientation
    a. What does CP look like in computer science? How is it different or the same from cultural relevant pedagogy?
    b. I should try and get a clearer understand of critical ped and culturally relevant ped in cs. also an idea as to how
    they collect their data, what do they use to illustrate their point.
    c. skim the intro, read the background, look at the data and results.

2. Summary
    a. The paper identifies the issue of underrepresentation of minorities in CS and offers 5 strategies to encourage
    minoirities in CS based on culturally relevant pedagogy.
    b. the conversation is the lack of diversity in cs and how to improve it.
    c. cs educators, researchers, people lookig to make cs more diverse

3. Assessment
    a. evidence is based on education theorists like vygotsky, freire, ladson-billings. there is no real evidence outside
    of the theories about education - no talking to professors, students, teachers, so on.
    b. the article is credible in that it cites all these theorists and other papers which is great. but its incredible to
    me in taht it's a lot of rhetoric. furthermore the ideas are great - sure have mentors that are the culture as the
    students and have all these great teachers - but the how is missing
    c. the points of view of theorists are included, as well as the of census and statistics. missing is the point of view
    of students and teachers. what do they think? do they implement these kinds of things? what are the challenges they face
    in implementing crp?

4. Use
    a. I'm biased against too theory heavy research about how practionners "should" be doing their job from people who
    don't practice. Also I am sensitive to social inequalities, but as a white man I don't experience them and that
    certainly limits my understanding. I still find this topic very important tho.
    b. implications for me: really have to think carefully and emphasize students' prior knowledge in building lessons and
    curriculum, as well as incorporate socio-political elements. implications for larger community: pushing towards
    inclusion in cs and ways to do it (if abstractly).
    c. this paper helped me understand the difference between crp and cp and clear strategies to implement crp in cs. yay!


Notes:

- culturally revelant pedagogy (crp) incorporates values, beliefs. customs of students into the learning
  experience. educators use topics of interest to students -> leads to more interest, inquiry, and involvement.
- Vygotsky - ideas are negotiated and konwledge is contextual. language is the medium of negotiation for ideas. learning
  is done through dialogue, not monologue. in CS, programming languages are the medium for negotiating and constructing
  ideas.
- sociocultural learning: learners take externally socially created knowledge, and try to internalize as part their own
  knowledge.
- CP -> teachers and students determine what the curriculum should be.
- CS content -> "neutral" but is it? Keywords are in english for most languages = western bias
- Computer science students who are members of underrepresented minority groups may learn how underrepresentation are
  caused or perpetuated in the field, and then be empowered to make changes to society to resolve these issues. In this
  case, learning to transform society goes along side academic development - page 3
- on the difference between crp v cp: cp - empowering the individual, crp - empoering groups.
- 5 strategies to improve minority enrollment:
    1. create good opportunities for students to learn (think zone of proximal dev, student's backgroudn)
    2. learning activities that are relevant in and out of the classroom, involving students home or personal lives.
    3. learning activities that are in interdisciplinary, based on student interests. don't restrict projects.
    4. incorporate socio-political factors in cs - why they are underrepresented, forms of oppression, and how to overcome them.
    5. mentor students out of the classroom, be open to helping them, especially wherer they are most vulnerable to
        attrition in the "pipeline". Mentors who have same culturl background as students = better

### None but ourselves can free our minds: critical computational literacy as a pedagogy of resistance
Clifford Lee and Elisabeth Soep

__ADD THE HOW TO READ QUESTIONS HERE__

- Critical computational literacy (CCL) -> combination of critical literacy and
computational thinking.
    - CCL "young people conceptualize, create, and disseminatedigital projects
      that break silences, expose important truths, and challengeunjust systems,
      all the while building skills such as coding and design"
- Students paired with adults to create a web-based interactive map of gentrification in Oakland.
- critical conscious: awareness and deep understanding of socio-poli forces that
  shape our lives.
- ethnographic data, year long study with youth in Oakland. Observed youth and
  adult staff brainstorm, analyze, reflect, so on.
- collegial pedagogy - adults and youth are colleagues
- research questions: "Whatconditionsmakelearningwithtechnologyeduca-tive,
  equitable, and empowering for youth of color who contend with structural
  inequalities?"
- youth participants displayed ccl in desgining their app (page 8)


### Good Reception: Utilizing mobile media and games to develop critical inner-city agents of social change
Antero David Garcia - thesis - 2012

- Literature review part is really good, page 29ish
- Critical pedagogy appraised by McLaren: cp has become "institutionally
  vulgazied and domesticated", "cp makes no claim to political neutrality".
    - Critical pedagogy is overly "hertorical" (Apple Buras 2007 p. 271).
    - Friere's work interpreted to the T - it needs to be adapted and reinvented
      for new and different audiences. Eric Weiner 2007 p. 60
- With participatory online media encouraging youth to comment, “like,” and
  “reblog” content, the role of critically exploring, consuming and producing in
  a digital age point to how critical literacies look fundamentally different in
  the twenty-first century p. 36
-  Elizabeth Quintero (2007) defines critical literacy as “a process of
   constructing and critically using language (oral and written) as a means of
   expression, interpretation, and/or transformation of our lives and the lives
   of those around us” (p. 202)." p, 37
- "literacy" has a lot of interpretations and ideas. More modern approachs don't
  look at literacy as a just mental - it's social too. "new literacies" new
  media literacy studies: individuals are more than meer consumers of content.
- stopped at 44

### Critical Pedagogy and Teaching Mathematics for Social Justice
David Stinson et al 2012

1. Orientation
    a. Why I'm reading this: to understand what CP looks like in mathematics. Maybe I
    can relate it to CS/give an idea as to what CS CP looks like.
    b. Try to get: concrete examples of critical pedagogy in math. Try to see how it
    can be applied to CS.
    c. Skim, look for the section talking about the research and data collected

2. Summary
    a. This grad-level CP class helped pre-service teachers become critical
    pedagogues.
    b. Conversation is about CP, it's applications, and effects for teachers and
    students. What does CP look like in the math class?
    c. Furture math teachers, teacher-education program teachers or program
    directors.

3. Assessment
    a. Evidence lies on 2 teachers experience who took the class and implemented
    teaching for social justice in their classes. Data is: ethnography of teachers,
    planning and implementing of a CP math lesson and reflection. This will do for
    evidence.
    b. Credibility: uses actual teachers in the class as well as a huge amount of
    references that really lay out the current state of math CP.
    c. Represented: teacher, some of the students, and the author (teacher of the
    math education class). Left out: none that I can think of. There is only some
    mention of students experience in the data.

4. Use
    a. My bias towards practical-oriented research definitely draws me towards this
    paper.
    b. impacts: helpful for future teachers and student teachers to see how this is
    implemented as well as the success that went with teaching math for social
    justice. Expands the literature about CP in math: appications, results, so on
    c. I think yes!

Notes:

- This paper contains a rich overview and references to other research about
  math and CP.
- Teachers really made the lesson relevant to the students. For the adult
  education math class, the teacher made the focus of the math class on the
  statistic of minimum wage - which captivated the attention of the
  students. Well done!
- It really is focused totally on the social justice element. I have concerns
  myself about the impact that has on teaching simply what is mandated - I guess
  my experience as a teacher makes me apprehensive to turn away from the
  mandated curriculum because I worry about students not passing standardized
  tests.
- When is CP a failure? This paper only touches on 2 teachers' experience. It
  would be interesting to learn about when CP doesn't work and why. Most papers
  feel like the "happy ever after" version - so positive.
